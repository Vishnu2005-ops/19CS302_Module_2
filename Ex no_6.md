# EX 6 C Program to print the string "SAVEETHA" n number of times.
## AIM:
To write a C Program to print the string "SAVEETHA" n number of times.

## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Declare an integer variable n
3. Ask the user to enter the value of n
4. Use a loop to repeat from 1 to n
5. In each iteration, print the string "SAVEETHA"
6. End

## Program:
```
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i,n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    for( i=1;i<=n;i++)
    
    {
    printf("SAVEETHA\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
